This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to cross-browser compatibility of event listeners.  The `bug.html` file contains code that uses the `attachEvent` method, which is now considered outdated and not supported by modern browsers. This can lead to unexpected behavior and prevent the event listener from functioning correctly on newer browsers. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version using the standard `addEventListener` method, ensuring broader compatibility.
